# CSV Analyzer - Machine Learning Model Evaluator

## Overview
The CSV Analyzer is a simple yet powerful tool that takes a CSV file as input and provides an analysis of its dataset. It evaluates multiple machine learning models on the dataset and recommends the best-performing model based on accuracy. Additionally, it allows users to make predictions based on input features.

## Features
- üì¶ **Dataset Information**: Displays the number of rows and columns in the provided CSV file.
- ‚úÖ **Model Recommendation**: Suggests the best-performing model with the highest accuracy.
- üèÖ **Model Performance Metrics**: Evaluates multiple machine learning models and presents accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- üîÆ **Prediction Functionality**: Users can input specific values and make predictions using the trained models.
- ‚¨ÖÔ∏è **File Upload Support**: Users can upload different CSV files for analysis.

## Supported Machine Learning Models
The following models are evaluated and compared:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **AdaBoost**

## How It Works
1. **Upload CSV File**: The user uploads a CSV dataset.
2. **Data Analysis**: The tool extracts the number of rows and columns.
3. **Model Training & Evaluation**:
   - Each supported model is trained on the dataset.
   - Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are calculated for each model.
   - The best-performing model is recommended.
4. **Prediction**:
   - The user can input feature values.
   - The recommended model predicts the outcome.
